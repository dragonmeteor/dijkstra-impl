# Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm in Multiple Programming Languages

I want to learn how to use various programming languages and tools to do things. Reading tutorials can help me get some feel, but that's not enough exposure. It's only you have implemented something complicated with a set of tools that you start to get a real feel for it.

[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) is a faily complicated algorithm. It requires you to implement a graph abstraction. It also requires you to implement a priority queue that allows key mutation. I believe it is a good programming exercise that can get you familiar with new programming languages.
